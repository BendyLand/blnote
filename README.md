*This project is in its very early stages as of 7/16/24 and is non-functional.*

A note taking application which displays your notes as interconnected nodes.

This tool is meant to hold and connect a bunch of small, single-thought notes that link together to form a larger idea. It is *not* meant to hold and organize several full-sized notes, like a notebook does.
